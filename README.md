```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Progetto-TrentoSicura/Backend.git
   cd Backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will start and be available at the configured port (typically http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes both unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

## API Documentation

API specifications are available in the `api-docs.yaml` file. This file contains:
- Available endpoints
- Request parameters
- Response formats
- Authentication requirements (if any)

## Development

### Project Architecture

This backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, orchestrating business logic
- **Middleware**: Process requests for authentication, validation, logging, etc.
- **Models**: Define data structures and handle database operations
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and connect them to appropriate controllers
- **Utils**: Provide reusable utility functions and helpers
